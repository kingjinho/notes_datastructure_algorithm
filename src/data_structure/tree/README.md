# Tree

### What is tree?
1. non-linear data structure(not stored in sequential manner, cannot traverse every element in a single run)
2. Data is stored hierarchically


3. Collection of entities called `nodes`, nodes are by connected by `edges`.
4. Each node may or may not have child node(s)
5. First node is called `root`
   

6. If nodes are connected, parent-child relationship will form.
7. nodes that do not have child called `leaves`
8. Height? length of the Longest path to a leaf from given node
   

9. Height of the tree? Maximum height and maximum depth
10. Depth? length of the path to its root
11. Level? Set of all nodes at given depth (root node is level 0)
    

12. Skew - every node has only one child (only left: left skew, right: right skew)




### Examples of trees
- Family tree
- Organization Structure
- DOM tree in HTML  
- Possible routes from home to destination
    - From home, we have 3 routes, and each route has another 2 routes, and each has another 5 routes to destination!


### Types of trees

1. Binary Tree
    - Each node has at most 2 children
    - Strict binary tree: each node has either 0 or 2 children
    - Full binary tree: each node has 2 children + all leaves are at the same level
    - Complete binary tree: every level except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far
 left as possible (used in heap)
