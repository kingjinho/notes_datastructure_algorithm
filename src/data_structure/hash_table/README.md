# Hashing

# What is Hashing?
- `A technique used for storing and retrieving information as quickly as possible`
- `The process of mapping the keys to locations`


# Why using Hashing?
- O(1) in insert, delete search on average
- In worst case : O(n)

# When to Use?
- Where number of possible keys are big 

# How is it called in Programming Language?
- HashTable, HashMap, Dictionary


# HashTable ADT
- Create HashTable
- Search key
- Insert key
- Delete key
- Delete Hash Table

# Understanding Hashing
- Case1: Think about an example where we find first repeated character in a given word
    - Solution would be to `create an array with size of ASCII code`, set all values with 0
    - As we iterate each string character, add values or return character that is repeated first
- Case2: What if it is to find first repeated number in a give number?
    - Solution above is not going to work because numbers are infinite
    - `We cannot create an array with infinite size and storing counters`
    
    

# Components of hashing
1. Hash Table
2. Hash Function
3. Collisions
4. Collision Resolution Techniques

# Choosing, or Creating Good Hash function does matter
