# Brute-Force algorithm

- Try everything to solve problem
- Example
  - Find a value from a list or array
- At least O(n)
- Most intuitive
- Good algorithm = efficiency
    - However, sometimes it just does not work
- Not always a bad thing

## Exhaustive search
- Search all
- O(n)
- Find value at array   
- Find mean, sum of an array
- Cracking password
- Reverse string

## Traveling salesman problem in brute-force 
- O(n!)

## Problem with exponential growth
- the more n, the slower algorithm is
