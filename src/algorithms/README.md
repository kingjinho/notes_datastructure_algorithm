# Efficiency of Algorithm

- Use of resources efficiently
    - CPU, memory...
- Complexity
    - Time complexity
    - Space complexity
- Time and Space in opposite direction
- Big-O notation
    - Used to classify algorithm
    - `The more data(input), the more time or space it takes increases`

`If an algorithm does not work properly, effciency does not matter`

# O(1)

- Constant no matter how large the size of input is

# O(n)

- Increase as the size of the input increases

# O(n2)

- Increase to n square as the size of the input increases

# O(logN)

- Number of execution converges as the size of input increases

# O(NlogN)

- Number of execution converges as the size of input increases
